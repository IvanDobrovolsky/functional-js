Promises are, just like callbacks, a way of dealing with things being asynchronous
- when we don't know for certain in what order things will happen.
 But promises are more powerful than callbacks because they compose -
  you can combine promises and chain them, all kinds of cool stuff - I've showed you some in this video,
  but there is WAY more you'll be able to do when you get comfortable with promises.
